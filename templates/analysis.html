          <p>
            Accuracy measures the percentage of correctly predicted instances. 
            Among the models used, Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Regressor and XGBoost stood out with a remarkable accuracy of 97.29%. 
            Random Forest and Voting Regressor followed closely at 94.59%, demonstrating consistent performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Models like Bagging Regressor and Linear SVR were less accurate, emphasizing the need for advanced ensembling or fine-tuning.

          <h2>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</h2>
          <p>
            Mean Absolute Error (MAE) represents the average magnitude of errors in predictions, providing a clearer perspective on a model's precision.
            Random Forest achieved the lowest MAE at 2.51, closely followed by XGBoost at 2.64, proving their robustness in fare prediction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Models with higher MAE, such as Linear SVR and Bagging Regressor, indicated potential room for improvement in handling complex patterns.

          <h2>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</h2>
          <p>
            RMSE provides a more weighted analysis of prediction errors, penalizing large deviations more than MAE. 
            Random Forest demonstrated a solid RMSE of 4.41, with XGBoost also performing well at 4.88.
          </p>
          <p>
            Models like Linear Regression and Linear SVR, while offering quicker predictions, had higher RMSE values, indicating limitations with outlier predictions.

          <h2>MAE Reduction Over Time</h2>
          <p>
            The "Mean Absolute Error (MAE) After Intervals" chart illustrates the progressive reduction in MAE as computational time (denoted in computational units, $) increases. 
            This trend highlights the model's ability to refine its predictions with additional training and optimization steps, achieving greater precision over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Observing the decline in MAE demonstrates the effectiveness of the modelâ€™s iterative improvements, ensuring more accurate fare predictions while maintaining computational efficiency.
